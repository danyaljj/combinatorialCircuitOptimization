# Optimizing Digital Combinatorial Circuits

The suit contains
- [Optimizer 1](optimizer1/): an optimization code in MATLAB. 
- [Optimizer 2](optimizer2/): another an optimization code in MATLAB! Essentially the same as above, but implemented by another person. Which one is better, I don't know! 
- [Circuit Visualizer] (visualizer/): a tool to visualize the output of the above optimization codes.
